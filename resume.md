## Work Experience 💼

### AI Research Engineer 🧠

**[Aria Studios Co. Ltd](https://showaria.com/)** &#124; **March 2024 - Present**

- **In-cabin Companion**: Developed an in-cabin assistant utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enhance the driving experience. The system integrates multiple models for user interaction, including [face identification](https://github.com/yakhyo/face-reidentification), [gender and age estimation](https://github.com/yakhyo/facial-analysis), and emotion recognition. These features facilitate personalized conversations with the driver. For speech-to-text functionality, the **whisper** model was employed. Deployed all services using Fast API on GCP and local machine.
- **LG Ground 220**: Designed and implemented the AI backend for MusicStudio and DJingStudio, enabling features such as lyrics generation from user input, cover image creation, and music generation using OpenAI, StabilityAI, and MixAudio APIs. Leveraged **LangChain** and concurrent programming to optimize API calls and reduce latency. Can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rkDN3T3bmQE).
- **Data collection tool for Virtual Character**: Developed a user interface that simulates a virtual character with predefined characteristics. The data collection team interacts with virtual character to gather additional data for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM). The tool is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using FastAPI, with PostgreSQL used to store the collected data.
- **GPT Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned the GPT-3.5-turbo model on conversation data of a virtual character to build a custom API for the virtual assistant. Performed several data augmentations using the OpenAI API for paraphrasing conversations.
- **LLMs Deployment**: Deployed a lightweight Phi-3 model for emotion detection from text on GCP using FastAPI and prepared a deployment container. The main objective was to detect users' emotions while interacting with a virtual character and responding accordingly.
- **VLMs Deployment**: Developed an "eye" for a virtual character to see and understand its surroundings, enabling it to interact with users. Deployed the Phi-3-Vision model on GCP for this purpose.
- **Face Parsing**: To improve face swapping performance, employed a Face Parsing model to segment the face. Enhanced model performance by modifying the feature extractor (backbone) and training strategy. Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/yakhyo/face-parsing).
- **Image enhancement & Face restoration & DeepFake**: Worked on image enhancement and face restoration to improve DeepFakes. Created a DeepFake video for KBS election process coverage. Can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/CGbvG8S7HHo?si=8j4R4-f5ICfz01GF).

### ML Engineer 🖥️

**[Pyler Co. Ltd](https://www.pyler.tech/)** &#124; **July 2022 - September 2023**

- **Video-based Visual Content Moderation**: Built a Video Moderation Pipeline to flag inappropriate video content using video recognition models, achieving over a 10% improvement in model accuracy.
- **Detection-based Visual Content Moderation**: Utilized segmentation and detection techniques to precisely detect unsuitable content for brand safety. Implemented state-of-the-art models in terms of real-time speed and efficiency, improving model precision and recall by around 15% through active learning techniques. Built an end-to-end pipeline on Kubeflow for training and deployment.
- **Classification-based Visual Content Moderation**: Leveraged multi-label and multi-head classification techniques to improve precision by approximately 20% using self-supervised and supervised training approaches. This novel approach showcases the adaptability and efficacy of the model for hard samples. Prepared Docker images for each development and deployment environment (containerization).
- **Model Assisted Labeling**: Created a pipeline for doing inference on existing labeled data and doing inference on unlabeled data. Improved labeling quality and speed using **Active Learning**.
