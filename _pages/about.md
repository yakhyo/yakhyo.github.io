I'm **Yakhyokhuja (Yakhyo) Valikhujaev**, an ML Software Engineer with over 4 years of industrial experience and 2+ years of academic research in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

## Professional Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Gachon University, where I specialized in computer vision and deep learning applications. My work focuses on developing and deploying production-ready ML systems that solve real-world problems across various industries.

Through this platform, I share insights from my journey in machine learning engineering, document technical challenges and solutions, and contribute to the broader ML community. I also maintain a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/codeuz) where I create programming tutorials.

## Technical Interests

My primary areas of focus include:

- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, segmentation, tracking, and facial analysis
- **Natural Language Processing**: Large language models, RAG systems, and text generation
- **MLOps**: Model deployment, optimization, and production pipelines
- **Deep Learning**: Neural architecture design and optimization

## Continuous Learning

I'm committed to staying current with the latest developments in ML/AI. Some technical books that have shaped my approach include:

- _Designing Machine Learning Systems_ by Chip Huyen (2022)
- _Fluent Python (2nd Edition)_ by Luciano Ramalho (2021)
- _Deep Learning with PyTorch_ by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann (2020)
- _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron (2017)

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding, I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/y_valikhujaev), contributing to open-source projects, playing chess, swimming, and hiking.

I also create programming tutorials on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/codeuz), where I've published courses on Python, C++, and Java for Uzbek-speaking learners.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing ML engineering, potential collaborations, or interesting technical challenges. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yakhyo9696@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/y-valikhujaev).
