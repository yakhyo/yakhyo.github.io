I'm **Yakhyokhuja (Yakhyo) Valikhujaev**, an AI/ML & MLOps Engineer with 6+ years of industry and research experience focused on Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and scalable MLOps infrastructure.

## Professional Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Gachon University, where I specialized in computer vision and deep learning applications. Currently, I work as an MLOps Engineer at [Thaki Cloud](https://www.thakicloud.com/), designing and maintaining Kubernetes-based ML platforms for distributed training and inference workloads.

My expertise spans fine-tuning and deploying transformer architectures, building Kubernetes clusters, and automating model training and deployment across cloud and on-prem environments. I focus on developing production-ready ML systems that solve real-world problems across various industries.

Through this platform, I share insights from my journey in machine learning engineering, document technical challenges and solutions, and contribute to the broader ML community. I also maintain a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/codeuz) where I create programming tutorials.

## Technical Interests

My primary areas of focus include:

- **LLMs & RAG**: LoRA/PEFT fine-tuning, retrieval pipeline design, vLLM-based inference orchestration
- **MLOps & Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster orchestration, workload scheduling, resource management, CI/CD pipelines
- **Conversational AI**: Voice-to-voice AI agents with ASR, LLMs, and TTS pipelines
- **Multimodal AI**: Vision-Language Models, OCR, object detection, tracking, video action recognition
- **Generative AI**: Diffusion Models, GANs, DeepFakes, image-to-video generation
- **Edge Deployment**: Model pruning, quantization, on-device inference optimization

## Continuous Learning

I'm committed to staying current with the latest developments in ML/AI. Some technical books that have shaped my approach include:

- _Designing Machine Learning Systems_ by Chip Huyen (2022)
- _Fluent Python (2nd Edition)_ by Luciano Ramalho (2021)
- _Deep Learning with PyTorch_ by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann (2020)
- _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron (2017)

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding, I enjoy swimming, hiking, and spending time with friends. I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and physics, and I'm interested in pursuing a PhD in the future if I find the right research opportunity that aligns with my interests in ML/AI.

I also solve algorithmic challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/y_valikhujaev), contribute to open-source projects, and create programming tutorials on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/codeuz), where I've published courses on Python, C++, and Java for Uzbek-speaking learners.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing ML engineering, potential collaborations, or interesting technical challenges. I'm particularly open to joining open-source projects or research initiatives that align with my interests in LLMs, MLOps, and AI infrastructure.
